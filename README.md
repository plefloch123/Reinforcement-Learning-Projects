# Reinforcement Learning Projects

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Projects repository! This repository contains implementations of two projects related to reinforcement learning using PyTorch.

## CartPole DQN Challenge

The "CartPole DQN Challenge" folder contains an implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for solving the CartPole environment. CartPole is a classic control problem in reinforcement learning where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart.

# MDP Maze Solver

The "MDP Maze Solver" project focuses on solving mazes using reinforcement learning techniques. The agent learns to navigate through a maze, making decisions based on the current state and available actions.
